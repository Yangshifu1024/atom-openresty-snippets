# OpenResty snippets for Atom

I could not update or unpublish the original repo [atom-autocomplete-openresty](https://atom.io/packages/atom-autocomplete-openresty),
so I created the new one here, so bad :)

Updated to OpenResty v1.9.15.1
  * lua_ngx
  * lua_mysql
  * lua_cjson
  * lua_upstream

TODOs:
  * All OpenResty libraries' snippets (Maybe not ^_^)
  * Pull requests are welcome.
